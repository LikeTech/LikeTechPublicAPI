# LikeTechPublicAPI (UNFINISHED)
Public version of my API used in my Minecraft plugins.
(NOTE: Not finished, it is very early in development - you may use it for now, but remember, it is still in its early stages of development)

# Usage
- To use, download the latest jar file from the releases page and include it in your project.
- Install the plugin on the Minecraft Server for it to work properly.

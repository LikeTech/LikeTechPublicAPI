# Experimental Branch
- Welcome to the experiemntal branch.
- There are features here which may not make it to the main version, but can still be tested/EXPERIEMENTED with (hence the name "experimental").
  - For this reason, it is not recommended to create plugins using the experimental version, as those features may be removed in the future. It should only be used for
  experimental purposes and testing purposes.
- SUPPORT WILL NOT BE PROVIDED FOR ANYONE USING AN EXPERIMENTAL VERSION, AS IT IS KNOWN TO HAVE ISSUES. YOU CAN SEND IN BUG REPORTS, BUT THEY MAY NOT BE ACTED UPON.
